This project uses libraries like csvReader to read a dataset calls illegal tobacco sales retrieved from data.gov, which account for illegal tobacco sold to youth (TSTY) under the age of 18 across California. The TSTY dataset was an annual survey that is conducted to gauge the rate of illegal tobacco sales to youth under the age of 18 across California, in accordance with Californiaâ€™s Stop Tobacco Access to Kids Enforcement Act (STAKE Act) and the federal Synar Amendment. Licensed tobacco retailers that are accessible to minors under the age of 18 throughout California are randomly selected for the survey. In the data set, variable YEAR represents a range of data collection from 1997-2018 of companies that sold tobacco to youth. Variable percent represents the percentage for each year. LOWER95 gives a range of number of youths that are below 95 from 1797-2018. UPPER95 gives a range of number of youths that fall above 95. A histogram for each of the variables is included, and descriptive characters like mean, standard deviation, etc. about the variables are included.
